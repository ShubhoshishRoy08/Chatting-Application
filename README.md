## 📌 Overview

This is a simple **real-time messaging application** built using **Java Swing** for the GUI and **Java Sockets** for network communication.

It demonstrates:
- Peer-to-peer text chat between two users.
- Basic user interface inspired by modern messaging apps.
- Smooth message display with timestamps.
- Easy to run — just start the server and connect with one or more clients.

## ✨ Features

✅ Real-time text messaging  
✅ Beautiful custom chat bubbles with timestamps

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 1️⃣ **Compile**

```bash
javac Server.java Client.java

### 2️⃣ **Run the Server**

```bash
java Server

### 3️⃣ **Run the Client**

```bash
javac Client

## ✅ How It Works

- The **Server** listens on port **6001**.
- The **Client** connects to **localhost:6001**.
- Both sides send and receive messages using **DataInputStream** and **DataOutputStream**.
- The **GUI** updates dynamically to display incoming and outgoing messages in separate panels.
